## Requirements clarifications

### Functional requirement

1. **URL Redirecting:** Given a shorten URL, redirect to the original URL.
2. **URL Shortening:** Create shorten URL from the original URL.
3. **Update Short URL:** Update an existing shorten URL.
4. **Delete Short URL:** Delete an existing shorten URL.
5. **Get URL Statistics:** Retrieve statistics for the shorten URL (e.g., number of times accessed).

For this project, we will not be implementing URL expiration functionality and user authentication/authorization.

To modify or delete a short URL, a secret key provided at the time of URL generation will be used.

### Non-functional requirement

1. The system should be highly available. This is required because, if our service is down, all the URL redirections will start failing.
2. URL redirection should happen in real-time with minimal latency.
3. Shortened links should not be guessable (not predictable).

### Assumptions

- 100 million URLs are generated per day
- The service is expected to operate for at least 10 years, resulting in the generation of approximately 360 billion links.

## System interface definition

### API Endpoint

The URL Shortener Service will expose the following REST API endpoints to support the basic use cases:

  {
    "result": true
  }
  ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Delete Shorten URL</summary>

- **Endpoint:** `/api/v1/shorten_urls/{shorten_code}`
- **Method:** `DELETE`
- **Description:** Delete the shortened URL.
- **Path Parameter:**
  - `shorten_code`: The shortened URL identifier.
- **Request Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "key": "unique_key_for_modification"
  }
  ```

- **Response:**

  ```json
  {
    "result": true
  }
  ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Redirect Shorten URL</summary>

- **Endpoint:** `/{shorten_code}`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Description:** Redirect to the original URL.
- **Path Parameter:**
  - `shorten_code`: The shortened URL identifier.
- **Response:**
  - **Status Code:** `302 Found`
  - **Headers:**
    - `Location`: The original URL

</details>

## Defining data model

## System Design and Algorithm

### URL Redirecting

There are two ways to handle URL redirection: using HTTP status codes 301 and 302.

1. **301 Moved Permanently:**
   - Indicates the URL has been permanently moved.
   - Browsers cache the redirection and search engines update their indexes.
   - Not suitable for frequently changing URLs or tracking clicks.

2. **302 Found (Temporary Redirect):**
   - Indicates the URL is temporarily located at a different URL.
   - Browsers do not cache the redirection and search engines do not update their indexes.
   - Suitable for frequently changing URLs and tracking clicks.

Because we want to update the URL and track clicks, we will use the 302 status code for our URL redirection.

### URL Shortening

We will need to convert the long URL to a short code, and the short code could be mapped back to the long URL

```https://www.example.com/very/long/url``` -> ```<<baseURL>>/{shortCode}```

#### Key length

The shortCode consists of charactor from ```[a-z][A-Z][0-9]``` equal 62 characters.

We expect to have 360 billion links to be generated so the shortCode length will be max 7 characters (```62^6 < 365 billion < 62^7```)

#### Generate short code

There are several methods to generate the shortCode, such as hashing the original URL, converting the ID of the URL object to base 64, or using a Key Generator Service as explained in the following resources:

- [URL Shortening Service Design](https://www.designgurus.io/course-play/grokking-the-system-design-interview/doc/designing-a-url-shortening-service-like-tinyurl)
- [System Design Interview â€“ An Insider's Guide](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF)

In this approach, I will generate the shortCode by combining the ID and creation time (in Unix time) and then converting it to base 64.

The trade-offs are summarized below:

| **Hash + collision resolution**                                  | **Base 62 conversion**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fixed short URL length.                                           | The short URL length is not fixed. It goes up with the ID.                              |
| It does not need a unique ID generator.                           | This option depends on a unique ID generator.                                           |
| Collision is possible and must be resolved.                      | Collision is impossible because ID is unique.                                           |
| It is impossible to figure out the next available short URL because it does not depend on ID. | It is easy to figure out the next available short URL if ID increments by 1 for a new entry. This can be a security concern. |

### Data Partitioning and Replication

### Cache

## Identifying and resolving bottlenecks

## Back-of-the-envelope estimation

### Performance Consideration

- Assuming a medium URL has 10,000 clicks, while the most popular URLs have millions of clicks.
- Assuming 500 million new URLs per month.
- The maximum size of a link is 2048 characters (2048 bytes), but let's assume the average length of a link is around 77 bytes (source: [Typical URL lengths for storage calculation purposes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6168962/typical-url-lengths-for-storage-calculation-purposes-url-shortener)).
- Our system supports tracking statistics of the shortened URLs, so the ratio of read to write operations could be 1:1.
